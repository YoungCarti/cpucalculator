- This project is a simple web development of a CPU Calculator (OS) -

  **The application allows users to add, edit, and remove processes, select different scheduling algorithms, and instantly see the results visualized in a Gantt chart along with detailed performance metrics.**

Features:

**1. Scheduling Algorithms**
   - First Come First Serve (FCFS)
   - Shortest Job First (SJF) - Non-Preemptive
   - Shortest Job First (SJF) - Preemptive (also known as SRTF)
   - Priority Scheduling - Non-Preemptive
   - Priority Scheduling - Preemptive
   - Round Robin (with configurable time quantum)
   
   **- (Upcoming release for SJF only)**

**2. User Interface**:
   - Clean, modern design with dark mode support
   - Responsive layout that works on all device sizes
   - Interactive process table for easy data entry
   - Visual Gantt chart to display the scheduling results
   - Detailed statistics for each process and overall metrics

**3. Key Components**:
   - Process table with editable fields for arrival time, burst time, and priority
   - Algorithm selector with all required scheduling options
   - Time quantum input for Round Robin algorithm
   - Gantt chart visualization with color-coded processes
   - Statistics table showing completion time, turnaround time, and waiting time
   - Summary cards for average metrics

**4. Technical Implementation**:
   - Built with Next.js for optimal performance
   - Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Implements shadcn/ui components for a polished look
   - Dark mode toggle with system preference detection
   - Comprehensive scheduling algorithm implementations
